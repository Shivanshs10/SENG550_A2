Advantages:
2 advantages of adding a MongoDB pipeline to the data architecture are that it improves read performance for analysis queries because MongoDB can store denormalized and pre-aggregated documents. This  makes analytical queries faster as fewer joins are needed. Another advantage is that it is better for scalability for reads because MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, so it can handle large volumes of read heavy workloads better than other databases can.


Disadvantages:
3 disadvantages of adding a MongoDB pipeline are that there is data redundancy and integrity issues because MongoDB stores denormalized data. This means there can be duplicated data which increases the risk of inconsistent data across documents. Another disadtantage is that it takes more effort because you need to have etl piplines, and have to handle data type conversions. Lastly, since data is not updated in real time, there can be data latency which is not helpful when you need the latest data.
